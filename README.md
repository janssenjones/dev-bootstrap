# Development Machine Bootstrap

This project is a repository of the scripts needed to setup my personal workstation. The intention is this is something I can update over time to reflect the evolution of the configurations I use.

## Setup steps

* Execute [Boxstarter](https://boxstarter.org/package/url?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/janssenjones/dev-bootstrap/main/boxstarter.ps1)
    * Note: This must be done in Microsoft Edge due to the use of an app launcher which is only supported there out of the box
