# Development Machine Bootstrap

This project is a repository of the scripts needed to setup my personal workstation. The intention is this is something I can update over time to reflect the evolution of the configurations I use.

## Setup steps

* Execute [Boxstarter](microsoft-edge:https://boxstarter.org/package/nr/url?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jwbennet/dev-bootstrap/main/boxstarter.ps1)
    * Note: This must be done in Microsoft Edge. The URL above should launch this in that browser, but if things do not start appropriately copy the URL and execute it manually.
